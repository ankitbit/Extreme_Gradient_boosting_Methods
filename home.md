***When you feel like giving up, do it tomorrow. When you have finally decided that you've done all you can do, and make the call to quit -- put it off until tomorrow.  Wanting to quit isn't something that's ever going to go away. 
The harder you struggle and the bigger your goals, the more you're going to feel the overwhelming pressure to quit***
